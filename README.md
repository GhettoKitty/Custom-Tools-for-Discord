## Introduction

### Overview
Briefly explain what the project is about, its purpose, and how it solves a problem.

### How to Install

You download discordtool.exe, right click, run it as admin and you are good to go!
Note that it may take a bit so you can just wait until it launches (there's a lot of code there so it's probably gonna take a long time ;-;)
