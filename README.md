## Introduction

### Overview
This Discord tool which took me briefly a month to make, basically let's you do stuff that you can't do in your normal discord,
It's basically a super enhanced version of your normal experience, we designed it for educational purposes + to help discord users enhance their normal experience

### How to Install

You download discordtool.exe, right click, run it as admin and you are good to go!
Note that it may take a bit so you can just wait until it launches. it can take up to 5 mins so don't close it early! (in the case if it takes longer than 5 minutes and your windows isnt bugged/theres no bugs, keep it running) but if it doesn't pop up in 5 minutes, contact me or make sure your windows isnt bugged
